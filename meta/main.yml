  synopsis: |
    This role can be used to manage user accounts (and user groups). You can
    manage almost all aspects of the users' account, like UID/GID, home
    directory, shell, ssh keys, etc. Accounts are configured using lists in 
    Ansible inventory, with separate lists for:

    * admin accounts;
    * global list of users created on each host in a cluster;
    * list of users created on a group of hosts;
    * list of users created on a specific host;
